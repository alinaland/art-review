            “Sometimes I ask myself what [Mark] Rothko would make of what I'm
            doing, whether he would be really disgusted that I put [the human
            figure] back in. Because that was a triumph for a lot of painters to
            get rid of the figure.”
          </h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Katherine Bradford</strong>'s <em>Paintings</em> are mildly
            clunky abstractions filled with domestic symbolism. Motifs and
            techniques from past bodies of work reappear here, with more or less
            success. The large canvases are filled with imposing blocks of
            color, awkwardly positioned, somewhat cartoon-like figures, and thin
            washes of acrylic paint. But her repetitive and limited approach
            unifies the work. The color fields are consistently flat, the
            figures are invariably outlined, and patches of thinned out acrylic
            are invariably if haphazardly, placed on top. Bradford makes it
            clear we are to take the figures lightly; there is humor in the
            awkwardness of the occasional big foot, or short arm, or block-like
            head. The figures, some of which are larger than life, are placed
            close to the edges of the canvas, as if they can barely fit into the
            picture plane, causing nice compositional tension. By contrast, in
            her earlier <em>Pool Paintings</em>, a great deal of compositional
            energy was expended on constructing a deep and vast space in which
            the unimposing figures are mere blobs of a single color. In this
            recent series, the figures are the center of attention and the space
            around them serves simply to contain and balance. The arms and hands
            of the figures all express one thing - comfort. And this brings us
            to a clear theme of the show, for this, comfort, is one of the
            central tasks of motherhood. The sense of warmth and domestic
            coziness in these paintings, especially in the gestures of the
            figures, surely also speaks to what we all can use as we make our
            way through this long pandemic. The scale of the mother figure in
            paintings such as <em>Motherhood</em>, <em>Mother's Lap</em>, and
            <em>Guest for Dinner</em> speak to the role of the mother from a
            child’s point of view. The mother's arms stretch unusually far to
            console her child in <em>Motherhood</em>, the mother's lap is
            unusually big in <em>Mother's Lap</em>Mother's Lap, and so able to
            accommodate all of her several children comfortably; in all of these
            paintings, the mother's presence takes over the room.

            <br />

            The bright reds, oranges, and pinks accentuate the light-hearted
            nature of the paintings; the frequent pale yellow adds a subtle
            glow. The dark outlines of the figures accentuate the figures’
            clunkiness, but in doing so, express the artist's confidence in her
            constructions. Each painting has some odd element or other that the
            viewer can't help but notice and attend to: a glowing pair of white
            undies, lumpy yellow circles for boobs, a funky pair of tights, a
            scribbled barely human face, a clownishly long bowling shoe. As much
            as these paintings reference classic color field abstraction, these
            odd elements also pull them towards a world of eccentric personality
            and striking atmosphere. It's as if Bradford is constructing the
            world as it might be when seen through the eyes of a child. The
            color blocks stand for auras or feelings, the odd symbols and
            fuzzed-out areas stand for things not completely understood. The
            grandeur of the mother figure dominates the child's vision,
            underscoring the role of the mother as the most important thing in
            the child's mind. A mix of satisfying and sometimes frustrating
            elements, it is a consistently engaging show.
